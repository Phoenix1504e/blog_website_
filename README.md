 This is a personal blog website which was realised because of a youtube video.
 You'll probably get bored with the specifics of the video so ill link it down below.

So after watching that video I started to search for a template for a blogging website as I was not good with html and css so writing a website was a huge task for me, then I found this website template which really helped me in accelerating the work and I could focus on learning programming as I was a student pursuing Computer Science. This blog webiste will mark my major challenges and achievements as I would not be able to make it as a diary as it is a very tiresome process and I'm not that punctual.
